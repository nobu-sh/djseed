title: Reserved Names
---

DJSeed has a handful of reserved event names and environment variables names that
cannot be overridden or reused without potentially breaking functionality.

## Environment Variables
These variables are utilized in the parent and worker threads to help communicate
primitive information. Assigning or overriding these variables will most likely cause breakage
if you don't know what you are doing.

- `DJSeed::Cluster_Util_Enabled`
- `DJSeed::Total_Shard_Amount`
- `DJSeed::First_Shard_Identifier`
- `DJSeed::Last_Shard_Identifier`
- `DJSeed::Child_Cluster_Identifier`
- `DJSeed::Total_Child_Cluster_Amount`

## Cluster Util Events
These are events emitted on [ClusterUtil](/docs/classes/clusterutil#events) and [ClusterEventEmitter](/docs/classes/clustereventemitter)
emitting these events manually with incorrect data may cause breakage.

- `Cluster_Util_Info` **[ClusterUtil](/docs/classes/clusterutil)**
- `Cluster_Util_Error` **[ClusterUtil](/docs/classes/clusterutil)**
- `Cluster_Ready` **Both**
- `Cluster_Death` **Both**
- `Cluster_Error` **Both**
- `Cluster_Warn` **Both**
- `Shard_Ready` **Both**
- `Shard_Resume` **Both**
- `Shard_Reconnecting` **Both**
- `Shard_Disconnect` **Both**
- `Shard_Error` **Both**

## Process IPC Payloads
Not to be confused with [IPC](/docs/classes/ipc)... [Process IPC](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processsendmessage-sendhandle-options-callback) is utilized to
communicate primitave messages to the worker threads as it is the easiest way to communicate between
processes. These are the most detrimental to the entire package so it is advised to stay away from using these names!


```js title="Example Process IPC Payload"
{
  payload: 'event_name',
  data: {
    ...
  }
}
```
> You can still use process IPC but it is suggested to structure your messages
differently so you don't need to worry about conflicting payloads.
