## About
DJSeed *(Dee-Jey-Es, See-Duh)* aims to be a quality of life addon for the popular
[Discord](https://discord.com/) interaction library [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).
It *will eventually* offer a bunch of tools which can be found on the [Roadmap](/docs/starting) *once its made*.
Currently DJSeed offers sharding and multithreading (clusters) which is quite frankly the most asked for thing.
So win, win... *right?*

## Installation

:::info

DJSeed as of (1/13/2022) depends on on [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) version `>= 13.5.0`

:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      npm i discord.js@v13-lts djseed@v13-lts
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      yarn add discord.js@v13-lts djseed@v13-lts
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      pnpm add discord.js@v13-lts djseed@v13-lts
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Basic Usage
This is the absolute basic way to use DJSeed, currently the only thing
we offer is multithreading so doing this will do absolutely nothing other
than prepare you for multithreading.

### Client
```js
const { Client, Intents } = require('djseed')

const bot = new Client('MY_COOL_TOKEN', {
  intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS],
})

bot.on('ready', () => {
  console.info(`Logged in as ${bot.user.username}#${bot.user.discriminator}!`)
  console.info(`Multithreading is ${bot.cluster ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}!`)
})

bot.login()
```

### Extra Notes

DJSeed only exports `Intents` from [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)!
If you wish to use other provided classes/methods/typedefs from [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
you must import them from it directly!
