title: Migrating From v13
---

The only change from `v13` to `v14` was `Intents` changed to `GatewayIntentBits`.

`Before`
```js
const { Client, Intents } = require('djseed')

const bot = new Client('MY_COOL_TOKEN', {
  intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS],
})

...
```

`Now`
```js
const { Client, GatewayIntentBits } = require('djseed')

const bot = new Client('MY_COOL_TOKEN', {
  intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds],
})

...
```

There will be a major overhaul for this package in the near future. It will go under beta v15 and stay beta until DJS makes makes a v15.
