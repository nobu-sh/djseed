## Overview

BeAPI (an abbreviation for "Bedrock edition API") is a tool that aims for a faster and more reliable development expierence when working with Minecraft Bedrock edition gametests. It currently consists of two major parts:

- `beapi-core`: is our core module that provides a handlful of features gametest does not offer at this time. It is also bundled with some cli commands to make development easier.

- `create-beapi`: is our module create app module which enabled clients to easily scaffold their first BeAPI project.


## Language Support

With gametest support being [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) supported only we are only really left with two primary options when it comes to language support.

The supported template presets are:

| Javascript | Typescript |
| :--------: | :--------: |
| vanilla    | vanilla    |

## Scaffolding Your First Project

:::caution Version Warning

BeAPI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version >= 12.0.0.

For best support it is recommended you install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/).

:::

To scaffold your first project you will need to navigate to your Minecraft `development_behavior_packs` folder which is usually located at `C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs`

### Installing

When creating BeAPI our main concern was simplicity for our end users when attempting to use our package. After some scheming we ultimetly decided NPM modules would be the best route.

Depending on your package manager, you will need to run one of the following commands.

NPM:
```bash
npm init beapi@latest
```
Yarn:
```bash
yarn create beapi@latest
```

### Building
Minecrafts gametest module linker is not the best thing known to man kind. To make everything function correctly you'll need to build the project every time you make a change so BeAPI can transpile its core module into your code.

NPM:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
Yarn:
```bash
$ yarn build
```

### Bundling
Once you feel you've finished your package and you're ready to prepare it for production and distribution you may want to bundle it into a `.mcpack` first.

NPM:
```bash
$ npm run bundle
```
Yarn:
```bash
$ yarn bundle
```

#### How Do I Tell The Bundler To Include More Files?
We realized when making Minecraft packs users may want to add more files to the final pack.
So we made the bundler parse a property in your package called `include`.
The bundler will recognize and recursively add any files or folders to the final bundled package.

This field should look like so:

```json
{
  "include": [
    "scripts",
    "manifest.json",
    "animation_controllers",
    "entities",
    "pack_icon.png"
  ]
}
```
